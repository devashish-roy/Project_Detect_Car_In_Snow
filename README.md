# Project_Detect_Car_In_Snow
**The problem:** capturing vehicles using data captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in different setting and under different snow cover conditions in the Nordic region. 

**The dataset:** Nordic Vehicle Dataset is a collection of 22 videos acquired using a Freya unmanned aircraft system from a range altitude range of 120-250 meters. The data covers different adverse weather conditions like overcast with snowfall, low light and low contrast conditions with patchy snow cover, high brightness, sunlight, fresh snow, and the temperature reaching far below – 0 degrees Celsius.
